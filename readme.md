The absence of JavaScript ensures that the website remains functional and accessible to a wide range of users, including those with limited browser capabilities.

The project adheres to a well-formed folder structure, maintaining consistent naming conventions for files and folders. Additional media elements, such as images and audio, are appropriately included.

### Page Count and Media

The project exceeds the baseline by encompassing 5-7 pages, incorporating images and consistent file naming. Additionally, it introduces media elements like audio and video to enhance the user experience.

## Context-Sensitive Navigation

The navigation throughout the website is context-sensitive, ensuring users can easily navigate between different sections. Appropriate use of semantic elements enhances the overall user experience.

## CSS Rules

The CSS rules are well-defined, with multiple stylesheets and some elements being reusable across pages. The README includes source attributions for transparency and credit.

## Design

The design of the website is consistent, with a careful selection of appropriate fonts and colors. Each page maintains a distinct theme and logical flow of content, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Sophisticated Color Usage

The project demonstrates sophisticated color usage, considering the color wheel, mood, and theme throughout the design.
